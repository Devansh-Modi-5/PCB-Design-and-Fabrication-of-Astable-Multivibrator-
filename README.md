# PCB-Design-and-Fabrication-of-Astable-Multivibrator-

**Tools used: EasyEDA**

* **End-to-end PCB development:** Designed a complete timer circuit using a 555 IC, starting from schematic creation and layout design with proper track width (1 mm) and clearance (0.5 mm), followed by Gerber file generation and manual fabrication.
* **Fabrication and troubleshooting:**

  * Transferred the layout onto copper-clad board using toner transfer and iron heat method.
  * Etched the board using ferric chloride, drilled component holes, and soldered verified components.
  * Resolved issues such as toner gaps and mirrored prints during iterative prototyping.
* **Testing and validation:** Assembled and tested the final circuit on both breadboard and PCB; validated timing behavior using an oscilloscope and confirmed >50% duty cycle as expected.
* **Outcome:** Successfully fabricated a functional PCB while gaining hands-on experience in common manufacturing challenges and circuit debugging.
